## üöÄ Implementation Examples

### Azure Speech SDK (Python)
```python
import azure.cognitiveservices.speech as speechsdk

# Configure speech service
speech_key = "YOUR_SPEECH_KEY"
service_region = "YOUR_REGION"

speech_config = speechsdk.SpeechConfig(subscription=speech_key, region=service_region)
speech_config.speech_synthesis_voice_name = "ar-OM-AyshaNeural"

# Create synthesizer
# Create a speech synthesizer object that will be used to generate speech from text
# using the configured speech service settings (voice, region, etc.)
synthesizer = speechsdk.SpeechSynthesizer(speech_config=speech_config)

# Synthesize text
text = "ŸÖÿ±ÿ≠ÿ®ÿßÿå ŸÉŸäŸÅ ÿ≠ÿßŸÑŸÉ ÿßŸÑŸäŸàŸÖÿü"
result = synthesizer.speak_text_async(text).get()
```

### Google Cloud TTS (Python)
```python
from google.cloud import texttospeech

client = texttospeech.TextToSpeechClient()

synthesis_input = texttospeech.SynthesisInput(text="ŸÖÿ±ÿ≠ÿ®ÿß ÿ®ŸÉŸÖ")

voice = texttospeech.VoiceSelectionParams(
    language_code="ar-XA",
    name="ar-XA-Chirp3-HD-Achernar"
)

audio_config = texttospeech.AudioConfig(
    audio_encoding=texttospeech.AudioEncoding.MP3
)

response = client.synthesize_speech(
    input=synthesis_input, voice=voice, audio_config=audio_config
)
```
