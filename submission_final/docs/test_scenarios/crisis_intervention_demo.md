**🤖 AI Response**: "**أخي العزيز، أشكرك إنك وثقت فيني وقلت لي هذا الكلام. هذا يحتاج شجاعة كبيرة.**

**أول شي وأهم شي: أبي أقولك إن حياتك غالية جداً عند الله وعندي وعند أهلك. هذا الألم اللي تحس به الحين مؤقت، ولكن الموت دائم.**

**في الإسلام، الله سبحانه وتعالى قال 'ولا تقتلوا أنفسكم إن الله كان بكم رحيماً'. ربنا يحبك ويريد لك الخير.**

**الحين أبي منك تسوي شيئين مهمين:**
**1. اتصل فوراً على 999 - هذا رقم الطوارئ في عمان**
**2. اتصل على أهلك أو صديق قريب يجي عندك**

**وأنا باقي معك هنا، ما رح أتركك لوحدك. قل لي: هل تقدر تتصل على 999 الحين؟**"

*(My dear brother, I thank you for trusting me and telling me this. This requires great courage.

First and most important thing: I want to tell you that your life is very precious to God and to me and to your family. This pain you're feeling now is temporary, but death is permanent.

In Islam, God Almighty said 'And do not kill yourselves, indeed God is merciful to you.' Our Lord loves you and wants good for you.

Now I want you to do two important things:
1. Call 999 immediately - this is the emergency number in Oman
2. Call your family or a close friend to come to you

And I'm staying with you here, I won't leave you alone. Tell me: can you call 999 now?)*

**🎤 User Input**: "لا أقدر أتصل... خايف أهلي ينكسفون مني. وما أبي أحد يعرف"

*(I can't call... I'm afraid my family will be ashamed of me. And I don't want anyone to know)*

**🔄 System Processing**:

**🤖 AI Response**: "**أفهم خوفك من نظرة الأهل، هذا شي طبيعي في ثقافتنا. بس خلني أقولك الحقيقة:**

**أهلك يحبونك أكثر من أي شي في الدنيا. لو عرفوا إنك تمر بهذا الألم، ما رح ينكسفون - رح يتألمون لأنهم ما عرفوا عشان يساعدونك.**

**في الإسلام، طلب المساعدة مو عيب، بل هو حكمة. الرسول صلى الله عليه وسلم قال 'المؤمن للمؤمن كالبنيان يشد بعضه بعضاً'.**

**الحين، إذا مو قادر تتصل على الأهل، اتصل على 999 بس. قل لهم إنك تحتاج مساعدة نفسية فورية. هم مدربين ومحترفين، وما رح يحكموا عليك.**

**أنا هنا معك، نقدر نتكلم لين ما الطوارئ توصل. هل تقدر تعطيني وعد إنك ما رح تؤذي نفسك؟**"

*(I understand your fear of family's view, this is natural in our culture. But let me tell you the truth:

Your family loves you more than anything in the world. If they knew you're going through this pain, they won't be ashamed - they'll be hurt that they didn't know so they could help you.

In Islam, asking for help is not shameful, but wisdom. The Prophet peace be upon him said 'The believer to the believer is like a building, parts of it support other parts.'

Now, if you can't call family, just call 999. Tell them you need immediate mental health help. They are trained professionals, and they won't judge you.

I'm here with you, we can talk until emergency services arrive. Can you give me a promise that you won't hurt yourself?)*
