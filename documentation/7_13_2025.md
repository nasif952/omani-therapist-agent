# 2025-07-13 Daily Progress Log

## What Was Done
- Fixed TTS streaming and playback: audio now plays in browser, no popups.
- Enforced strict turn-taking: user cannot speak while TTS is playing.
- Added detailed diagnostics for TTS chunking, playback, and WebSocket flow.
- Improved frontend chat UI: full message history, alternating user/AI bubbles.
- Created and pushed new branch: `v3_realtime_audio`.
- Updated `README.md` with v3 features, setup, and usage.

## How & Methods
- Refactored frontend to disable mic during TTS, re-enable after.
- Used React state and refs to manage turn-taking and audio.
- Backend now uses correct TTS method, streams audio in base64 chunks.
- Added logging at every step (backend and frontend) for debugging.

## Why
- Previous versions allowed user to speak during TTS, causing overlap/confusion.
- Audio popups were disruptive; now audio plays seamlessly.
- Diagnostics/logs help with future debugging and reliability.

## Remaining Work
- UI/UX polish (avatars, timestamps, mobile layout)
- Error handling for network/audio failures
- User settings (voice, speed, language)
- Deployment scripts and Dockerization
- Security review and rate limiting
- Automated tests (unit, integration, e2e)

## How Can Be Done
- UI: Use CSS modules or styled-components, add avatars, timestamps.
- Error handling: Add try/catch, user notifications, fallback UI.
- Settings: Add a settings modal, store preferences in localStorage.
- Deployment: Write Dockerfiles, GitHub Actions for CI/CD.
- Security: Review CORS, auth, input validation, add rate limiting middleware.
- Tests: Use Jest/React Testing Library for frontend, pytest for backend.

## Alternatives Considered
- Could use Web Audio API for more advanced playback (e.g., volume, pause/resume).
- Could use a queue for TTS requests if multiple users/sessions.
- Could use a state machine for more robust turn-taking.

## Extra Info
- All changes are in `v3_realtime_audio` branch.
- See `README.md` for setup and usage.
- See `Left_to_do.md` for roadmap and open questions.
