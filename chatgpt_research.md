Plan for Finalizing and Deploying the Project in 3 Days
Overview of Remaining Tasks
To complete the project within the next 3 days, we should focus on two key areas: finalizing the implementation with minimal dependencies and ensuring smooth deployment. Given the time constraint, we will prioritize solutions that are quick to implement, easy to deploy, and reliable. The plan includes:
Using cloud-based AI services (OpenAI/Anthropic and Azure Cognitive Speech) to handle ML tasks, avoiding local ML libraries that could complicate deployment.
Simplifying any text processing using regex where appropriate (for quick, deterministic parsing) when an AI call is overkill or too slow.
Choosing a deployment platform (Vercel is preferred for its simplicity and free tier, with Azure as a backup since it also offers free allowances) and preparing the app for deployment with minimal friction.
Outlining a demo video gameplan to showcase all important features and the integration of components.
This structured approach will help leverage your fast development skills effectively over 3 days. Below, we break down the decisions and steps in detail.
Choosing Cloud ML Services vs Regex for Tasks
Using cloud-hosted ML models (like OpenAI’s GPT or Anthropic’s Claude via their APIs) is advantageous because it offloads heavy computation to those services. This means you don't need to package large ML models or libraries with your app – reducing dependency issues and deployment complexity. In fact, integrating these APIs mostly requires just obtaining API keys and using HTTP calls (or lightweight SDKs). As one guide notes, you simply sign up for the AI providers (e.g. OpenAI, Anthropic) and obtain API keys to start using their models
vercel.com
. This cloud approach should be fast enough for a responsive app, as OpenAI’s models can return results in a matter of seconds for typical prompts (millisecond-level per token processing in many cases
community.openai.com
). However, not every task requires an AI call – for simpler, rule-based text processing (like extracting a keyword or formatting an output), using regular expressions (regex) can be much faster and sufficient. Regex is lightweight and runs locally with no external calls. An answer on Data Science StackExchange aptly advises: “Using regex is definitely easier…but you will not be able to cover everything… If you can cover the requirement with regex go for it. If regex will not be a good solution then start thinking in machine learning solutions.”
datascience.stackexchange.com
datascience.stackexchange.com
. In practice, this means:
Identify any subtasks in your project that have a predictable pattern (for example, maybe detecting a command like "what's the weather" or parsing a name after "My name is ..."). Implement those via regex to save time and avoid unnecessary API calls.
For more complex language understanding (open-ended queries, chit-chat, complex instructions), rely on the ML model through the cloud API, since regex or simple rules won’t suffice for the breadth of natural language.
By combining these, you ensure the fastest performance (regex for trivial cases) and broad capability (cloud AI for understanding anything else) while keeping the code simple. Crucially, this approach avoids adding heavy ML libraries or training models yourself – which is impractical in 3 days and would introduce deployment hurdles.
Ensuring Easy Deployment (Minimizing Dependencies)
To make deployment easy, we want to minimize library and environment issues. Here are specific recommendations:
Use Cloud APIs over Local Libraries: As decided, use the OpenAI/Anthropic API for AI responses and Azure’s Speech service for speech-to-text (STT) and text-to-speech (TTS). This way, you only need the SDKs or HTTP requests, rather than any local ML processing. The OpenAI Python SDK (openai library) and Anthropic SDK are both lightweight clients that should install without trouble. Azure’s official Speech SDK (azure-cognitiveservices-speech) is somewhat larger, but we can avoid potential issues by calling the REST API instead. Azure’s Speech service provides REST endpoints for STT and TTS which you can call with standard HTTP requests (using Python’s requests library). In fact, Microsoft’s documentation provides a Python REST example where the only requirement is to install requests – you post your audio to the endpoint with the proper headers and subscription key/token
learn.microsoft.com
learn.microsoft.com
. Using the REST API means you don’t need to bundle the entire Azure SDK or any audio drivers, reducing library complexity. This is ideal for deployment since making an HTTP request is straightforward in any environment.
Remove or Replace Heavy/Unnecessary Packages: From your requirements, one library that stands out is Pygame. Pygame is used for audio playback in a local environment, but on a deployed web app (especially if hosted on Vercel or Azure), you won’t have a GUI or speakers to play sound. It’s better to remove Pygame from the deployment. For TTS output, a simpler approach is to have the backend generate an audio file (e.g., get an MP3/WAV response from Azure TTS) and send that to the client, where you can play it in the browser using an HTML audio element. This removes the need for Pygame entirely (no more SDL dependencies or display requirements in the server). If needed, you can generate audio on the server and provide a download or stream, or use Azure’s TTS viseme or stream directly to the client. In summary, dropping Pygame will avoid potential library conflicts on Vercel and reduce your package size.
Pin and Test Dependencies: Ensure your requirements.txt is up to date with only the needed libraries (Azure SDK if using it, or just requests if using REST, plus openai, anthropic, python-dotenv, etc.). Since time is short, use the exact versions you have already tested locally to avoid any surprise in behavior. Vercel’s Python runtime will install these from requirements.txt during deploy
vercel.com
, so the smaller and well-specified this list is, the smoother deployment will be.
Environment Variables: Keep all keys and secrets (API keys for OpenAI, Anthropic, Azure) in environment variables, not in code. You’re already using python-dotenv, which is great for local testing. For deployment, both Vercel and Azure allow setting env variables securely. On Vercel, you can add them via the dashboard or CLI, and on Azure you can add them in the configuration settings. This ensures no hardcoded secrets and makes switching between environments easier. (It also means you can show your code in the demo without revealing keys.)
By following these steps, we satisfy the requirement of using “the one that will be easily deployable… with no library/package issues” (per your point 1). The solution will rely on cloud services (just needing HTTP calls) and basic Python standard libraries, making it lightweight and portable.
Deployment Platform: Vercel vs Azure (Free Options)
For deploying the app, Vercel is the preferred choice given its simplicity and generous free tier. Vercel was designed for quick deployments of web apps and APIs, and it now supports Python backend functions as well. In fact, Vercel recently introduced a Python runtime for serverless functions that lets you deploy Flask or FastAPI apps easily
vercel.com
. Many developers highlight Vercel’s ease of use – “Vercel provides a very simple way… for deploying applications... One big benefit is that it is Free!”
stackademic.com
. With the free plan, you get 100 build minutes and 50 GB of bandwidth per month
reddit.com
, which is typically plenty for a demo project. How to deploy on Vercel (Python approach): Given you likely have a Python codebase, you can wrap it in a small Flask or FastAPI API. For example, create an api directory with an index.py where you initialize a Flask app and define routes (e.g., one route for processing user queries). Vercel will detect this as a serverless function. (Ensure your vercel.json rewrites all routes to /api/index as per Vercel’s Python deployment guide.) The Vercel documentation confirms you can use a requirements.txt and it will install those packages in the serverless environment
vercel.com
. Many have successfully deployed Flask APIs on Vercel’s free tier
stackademic.com
stackademic.com
. The deployment process is straightforward: push your code to a Git repository and import into Vercel, or use the Vercel CLI to deploy directly. In short, Vercel gives a quick, hassle-free deployment for our use case, with no cost. Azure as an alternative: If needed, Azure can also be used without cost (to an extent). Azure offers a free tier for web apps and functions – for instance, Azure Static Web Apps (SWA) has a free tier that can host static sites and a certain amount of serverless function execution. Azure also offers a free allowance on its Speech service usage (5 hours of STT and 0.5 million characters of TTS per month are free
azure.microsoft.com
azure.microsoft.com
), which is great since you plan to use those. However, hosting a Python app on Azure might be a bit more involved than Vercel. You could use Azure App Service on the free tier (F1 plan) to run a Flask server, or an Azure Function (with a Consumption plan, which has a monthly free grant of execution time). It’s doable, but the setup and deployment steps are more complex than Vercel’s one-click approach. As one comparison noted, Azure’s pricing and setup can be complex (multiple resources, pay-as-you-go for each service), whereas Vercel has a straightforward model and developer-friendly interface
reddit.com
reddit.com
. Given our time constraint, you should only pivot to Azure if Vercel has an unforseen limitation or if you specifically need closer integration with Azure services. Recommendation: Try deploying on Vercel first (it’s likely sufficient for the demo, and you expressed preference for it). You have no preference for tech stack, so using the Python API on Vercel or even converting portions to Node/Next.js on Vercel are both options. Since you’re familiar with Python, sticking to it will be fastest – you can have a Flask route that: accepts input (text or audio upload), calls Azure STT if needed, calls OpenAI/Anthropic for AI response, calls Azure TTS for speech output, and returns the result (text and/or audio URL) to the frontend. All this can live in the serverless function. The front-end could be a simple HTML/JS page (or a minimal Next.js app) that hits this API and handles microphone input/audio output. Vercel will host both seamlessly. If Vercel’s environment poses any library issue (for example, if azure-cognitiveservices-speech had a binary dependency issue, though unlikely), a backup is deploying on Azure App Service. Azure’s free tier will run a small Flask app – you’d use the Azure CLI or portal to deploy your code. But note that Azure’s free tier web app has low resources and might cold-start slowly. Still, for completeness: it’s free and your Azure Speech keys will work directly there. In summary, Vercel is highly recommended for its speed and simplicity, with Azure as a contingency since it does have free offerings and you are already using Azure’s cognitive services.
Demo Video – What to Show and Emphasize
Your demo video should clearly illustrate the functionality and strengths of your project. Since you have a voice-based AI assistant (as inferred from the speech and AI integration), here are the key points and parts to showcase:
Introduction (brief): Start by introducing what the application is. For example, “This is a voice-enabled AI assistant that converts speech to text, uses an AI model to answer, and then speaks the answer back to you.” Keep this very short (a few seconds) – the goal is to set context.
Setup/UI Overview: Show the interface the user interacts with. If it’s a web interface, point out the microphone button or input field. If it’s console-based (less likely, but if so), show how you start it. This lets viewers know how to operate it. For instance, demonstrate clicking a “Start Recording” button if there is one.
Voice Input and Speech-to-Text: Demonstrate the speech recognition in action. For example, speak a query (capture yourself or on-screen indication of audio input). The app should then display the recognized text. Show the transcribed text on screen, highlighting that Azure’s Speech service accurately converted your speech to text. This is a “wow” factor and confirms the first part (STT) works. You might say something like, “What’s the weather in New York tomorrow?” and viewers will see that appear as text.
AI Response (Brain of the assistant): After the query is recognized, the system will process it with the AI model. You should show that the query is being sent to OpenAI/Anthropic (maybe a loading spinner or simply a short pause). Then display the AI’s text response. For instance, the assistant might answer “The weather in New York tomorrow will be sunny and 25°C.” Show this answer appearing in text form. This demonstrates the integration of the ML model. Emphasize that this answer is generated by the AI (you could verbally note it or overlay a subtitle like “Response generated by GPT-4 via OpenAI API”).
Text-to-Speech Output: Immediately follow with the assistant speaking the answer. Your application should take the AI’s text and synthesize speech via Azure TTS. In the video, make sure the audio is captured: viewers should hear the assistant’s voice speaking the answer. If possible, also show an indicator on screen (like an audio player or an animated icon) during speech playback. This part highlights the end-to-end nature: the user’s speech went in, and now speech comes out as the answer. The quality of Azure’s neural voice will be a strong point to mention (it sounds natural, etc.), though the demo will let them hear it.
Multiple Rounds / Features (if applicable): If your assistant supports follow-up questions or multiple turns, show a quick second interaction. For example, you could ask another question or a different type of query (“Tell me a joke” or “What is the capital of France?”). This shows that the system works generally, not just for one hard-coded prompt. It also tests any context handling if you built that. If you implemented any special commands or regex-based triggers, demonstrate one. For instance, if saying “Open notepad” triggers a regex-based action (just hypothetical), show that. This will illustrate the regex fallback working. Only do this if such features exist; if not, focusing on Q&A and conversation is fine.
Error Handling (optional): If you have time in the video, you might show how the system handles an unrecognized speech or an out-of-scope request. For example, speak very unclear or nonsense and show that either it asks you to repeat or the AI says it didn’t understand. This is not mandatory for every demo, but it gives a sense of robustness. Keep this brief if included.
Architecture Highlights (optional, very brief): Towards the end, you may include a slide or verbal note about the tech stack: e.g., “This demo uses Azure Cognitive Services for speech (which has free usage of 5 hours STT and 0.5M chars TTS per month)
azure.microsoft.com
azure.microsoft.com
, and OpenAI’s API for the language model. The app is deployed on Vercel, which enables free, fast deployments
stackademic.com
.” This is just to give credit to the components and could impress an evaluator that you used industry-grade services wisely. Keep it high-level; the video should not be too slide-heavy – the live demo is the star.
Closing: End the video after a successful interaction or two, with a short statement like “And that’s how our voice assistant can answer your questions! Thank you.” Keep the whole video concise (probably 2-3 minutes total) focusing on the live demo.
Throughout the demo, focus on the seamlessness: highlight that the chain of technologies (speech to text, AI reasoning, text to speech) works together quickly and reliably. Since you’ll create the video yourself, plan your narration or annotations to mention these points. For example, while the assistant is speaking the answer, you might narrate “Now the answer is being spoken using Azure’s text-to-speech.” If the demo UI is clear enough, narration might not even be needed, but usually some explanation helps. Finally, make sure to test everything beforehand so that in the recording you don’t hit unexpected snags. Given the tight timeline, a dry run or two on the day of recording (Day 3) will help iron out any kinks.
3-Day Execution Plan
To achieve all of the above in 3 days, here’s a suggested breakdown:
Day 1 – Code Finalization: Finish integrating the cloud services and regex logic into your project.
Implement the logic to use Azure STT/TTS via REST or SDK (test it locally with your keys).
Integrate OpenAI (or Anthropic) API calls for generating responses. Test a full cycle locally: give a sample audio or text and verify you get a spoken answer back.
Replace or remove any components that might cause deployment issues (e.g., remove Pygame and instead save audio to a file or return it to client).
Test regex-based parts: make sure any regex for quick parsing works as expected on sample inputs.
Basically, by end of Day 1, you want the core functionality working locally in a Python environment (perhaps triggered via a simple Flask route or even a script).
Day 2 – Deployment Setup: Focus on deploying the application and ironing out any platform issues.
Set up a minimal front-end if not already (could be an HTML page with some JS to record audio and hit your API, or a simple Next.js app). If front-end development is not your forte, even a bare-bones interface is fine – the demo’s emphasis is on functionality, not UI polish. There are example React integrations for Azure Speech SDK if needed, but given time, a simpler approach is to use an <input type="file"> for audio or a small recording script. Decide what’s quickest for you.
Deploy to Vercel. Create a new project, push your code, and watch the deployment logs. If any errors arise (e.g., a library failing), address them: you might need to adjust requirements.txt or add a config in vercel.json. Remember, Vercel supports Python (Beta) and can run Flask apps
vercel.com
. Many have done this without issue, but since it’s beta, just be ready to adjust if needed. The Stackademic guide shows that with the proper structure and a vercel.json rewrite, it works
stackademic.com
.
Once deployed, test the live app URL. Check that you can record or input text and get responses. Monitor any logs for errors (Vercel’s dashboard or vercel logs CLI can help).
If Vercel proves troublesome for any reason, pivot to Azure: create an Azure App Service and deploy (perhaps using the Azure CLI or VSCode Azure extension). Given your familiarity with Azure (since you set up Cognitive Services), this is a backup. But note the free tier of App Service might have slower performance – acceptable for a demo if needed.
By end of Day 2, you should have a working deployed version of your app that anyone (or at least you) can access through a URL.
Day 3 – Testing and Demo Preparation: Now that the app is live, do thorough testing and prepare the presentation.
Test multiple scenarios on the deployed app: different questions, long queries, no-speech (silence) handling, etc., to ensure stability. Fix any last-minute bugs.
Prepare the demo script: Decide exactly what you will say and do in the video. It helps to write down the questions you will ask the assistant and the expected answers (so the AI doesn’t surprise you in a bad way during recording!). Because the AI’s response can vary, you might consider using a somewhat deterministic prompt or a fixed LLM temperature for consistency. For example, you can set the OpenAI API parameter temperature=0.5 or so for less randomness. It’s okay if the responses are a bit different, but make sure they are correct or at least sensible in context.
Record the demo video focusing on the points discussed in the previous section. Use a clear microphone for your voice and ensure the output voice is captured (you might have to record system audio if the assistant’s voice is played on your computer). If direct capture is hard, as a workaround you could hold a phone to record the interaction, but a screen capture tool with audio is preferable for clarity.
Highlight the critical parts: speech recognition working, AI answer, speech synthesis. Speak clearly and maybe choose queries that you know the AI can handle accurately and quickly. (Avoid extremely long or complicated queries to keep the video flowing and within time.)
After recording, review the video once to make sure all important parts are audible/visible. It’s fine if the video is informal as long as it demonstrates the functionality.
By following this plan, you leverage the remaining 3 days efficiently. You’ll use Day 1 to get the technical foundations solid, Day 2 to ensure deployment & access, and Day 3 to validate and showcase the project. Each piece (cloud ML integration, regex fallback, deployment, demo) reinforces the requirement of an easily deployable solution that works fast and can be impressively demonstrated.
