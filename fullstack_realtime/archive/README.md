# Archive Directory

This directory contains all non-essential files that have been organized for project clarity while preserving complete project history.

## Directory Structure

### üìÅ `documentation/`
**Project documentation and guides that are not actively used for development**

- `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` - Production deployment instructions and configurations
- `main_project_task.md` - Original technical assessment requirements
- `project_progress_plan.md` - Development roadmap and milestones
- `test_report.md` - Historical test results and analysis

### üìÅ `deployment_configs/`
**Alternative deployment configurations for different platforms**

- `railway.toml` - Railway.app deployment configuration
- `render.yaml` - Render.com deployment settings
- `vercel.json` - Vercel deployment configuration
- `.dockerignore` - Docker build exclusion patterns

**Note:** The main `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` remain in the project root as they are the primary deployment method.

### üìÅ `planning/`
**Project planning documents and task management files**

- `LEFT_TO_DO.md` - Remaining development tasks
- `To_Complete.md` - Comprehensive task checklist and progress tracking

### üìÅ `legacy/`
**Historical files and previous versions**

- `archived_files/` - Previously archived files including:
  - `omani_therapist_ai.py.backup` - Backup of main AI system
  - Historical test files and results
  - Legacy therapy session transcripts
  - Old emotion processing test files

## Why These Files Were Archived

### Development Focus
The main project directory now focuses on:
- **Active development** (api/, frontend/, tests/)
- **Essential documentation** (SETUP_GUIDE.md, CODEBASE_DOCUMENTATION.md, README.md)
- **Core configuration** (package.json, .env, docker files)
- **Current test results** (technical_assessment_submission/)

### Project Clarity
- Reduces cognitive load when navigating the project
- Makes it clear which files are actively used vs historical
- Maintains professional appearance for technical assessment
- Preserves all work while organizing logically

## Accessing Archived Files

All files remain accessible and can be moved back to the main directory if needed for active development. Nothing has been deleted - only reorganized for clarity.

## Archive Maintenance

When adding new files to the archive:
- Place documentation in `documentation/`
- Place deployment configs in `deployment_configs/`
- Place planning docs in `planning/`
- Place old/backup files in `legacy/`
